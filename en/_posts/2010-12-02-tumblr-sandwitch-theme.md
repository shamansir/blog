Have created [Tumblr theme](http://www.tumblr.com/theme/18012) named [Sandwitch](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Sandwitch). I was going to make tumblr-blog look like [showdown blog](http://code.google.com/p/showdown-blog/)-engine style I've made, and seems the result in the end is even better!

You can turn on tweets translation, allow [Disqus](http://disqus.com) comments and... write posts with source code highlighting!

To use source code highlighting it is required to make first line in your code blocks to be something like `#!xml`, so I recommend to write them using `Markdown`-edtior (it can be selected in your [profile preferences](http://www.tumblr.com/preferences)). [SHJS](http://shjs.sourceforge.net/) (copied to `static.tumblr`) is used to make it work. You also must specify programming languages used in blog manually (not just by checking "Highlight code" checkbox) in the sort of: `['html','css','xml','javascript','java','python','sh']`. The languages you can enable are: `html` (HTML), `xml` (XML), `css` (CSS), `javascript` (JavaScript), `python` (Python), `java` (Java), `ruby` (Ruby), `sql` (SQL), `sh` (Unix Shell), `php` (PHP), `cpp` (C++), `csharp` (C#).

To translate tweets, set your "Twitter username" at [theme customization](http://www.tumblr.com/customize).

To turn on [Disqus](http://disqus.com), set your "Disqus shortname" at the [very same settings](http://www.tumblr.com/customize).
