title: Redeploying an Application to Tomcat with Ant

The process of out project development has one drawback, which is common to many serious J2EE-projects: after applying changes to the code code and further recompilation, a server do not catches a new version automatically, but requires stoping it, cleaning cache, restarting it again and then, redeploying a package.

Not to make this by hands every time, there are several ways to automate it manually (hm...): for example, a batch or shell scripts for Windows or Linux accrodingly. But it seems to me, that it is more logical to entrust this work to the compiling ant-script: you press a button and everything restarts and reassembles by itself.

(this version is for Windows)

So I have taken an existing script and started to revise it. I've found several tricks about ant on Windows (but they are, may be, a common thing for a man who experienced with ant building :) ), and I've got the following script as a result.

Here is the `build.properties` file. It contains a values that may change frequently so it is better to store them separately from the ant script.

    # package name
    war.name = SomeProjectPackage

    # path to JDK
    java.home = "C:\Worktable\Java\jdk1.5.0_12"
    # path to the server root directory
    server.dir = C:/Worktable/Java/apache-tomcat-5.5.25
    # script that is used to start server
    server.command = catalina.bat

    # path to the project root directory
    root.dir = C:/Workspace/SomeProject
    # path to the place where package must be deployed
    deploy.dir = ${server.dir}/webapps/

    # JPDA setting (you can use a remote debugging by
    # (for example, Eclipse can) connecting to the specified port)
    jpda.transport = dt_socket
    jpda.port = 56666

    # path to the project libraries
    lib.dir = ${root.dir}/lib/
    # path to the project's temporary assemblage place
    dist.dir = ${root.dir}/dist/
    # path to the directory with web-content: pages, scripts, images and so on
    web.dir = ${root.dir}/WebContent/

Now let us consider the script part by part. In the heading - we include our `.properties` file.

    #!xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

        <project name="SomeProject" default="redeploy" basedir=".">
        <property file="build.properties"/>

        . . .

Now the compilation target goes (`build`), the target cleaning temporary directories used while building (`clean`), and the rebuilding which, in fact, cleans and then builds the package (`rebuild`).

    #!xml
        . . .

        <!-- Compiles project with all dependencies. -->

        <target name="build"
                description="--> compiles project with all dependencies">
            <mkdir dir="${dist.dir}"/>
            <mkdir dir="${dist.dir}/classes"/>
            <javac source="1.5"
                srcdir="${root.dir}/src"
                destdir="${dist.dir}/classes"
                debug="on"
                verbose="false"
                optimize="on">
                <classpath>
                    <fileset dir="${lib.dir}" includes="**/*.jar"/>
                </classpath>
            </javac>
        </target>

        <!-- Cleans the build. -->

        <target name="clean"
                description="--> cleans the build">
            <delete quiet="true" dir="${dist.dir}"/>
        </target>

        <!-- Rebuild. -->

        <target name="rebuild" depends="clean,build"
                description="--> [clean, build]"/>

        . . .

And now the subject targets of the article -- a deploying target (put a new package to the servers), de-deploying target (taking an old package from server) and re-deploying target (which, in fact, takes and then puts).

When deploying (`deploy`) we compile the code (`depends="build"`), then create the logs directory at the server, then constructing a package from the compiled sources (with `jar` command) and putting it to a temporary directory, and then we start a server. The server can be started from ant-script only from inside its own environment, in case of Windows, so we need to call it using `cmd /c catalina.bat jpda start` command with ant `exec` (arguments must be separated the exactly same way as you see them below -- `exec` must wrap the whole `catalina jpda start` command with quotes correctly). Also we need to pass several environment variables to server, what we do using `env` commands. The server is started in separate thread (`spawn="true"` -- or else the script will inactively wait for a server to return an exit code that will not happen while server is running) and in the clean way (not using java-vm -- `vmlauncher="false"`). Now server is running, we can deploy a package there and then clean up the temporary directories and files (`copy` and `delete` commands sequence).

To unload a package from server (`undeploy`) we stop the server using the rules specified above (when stopping we can't specify JPDA variables and wait for a server to stop; but if something had failed -- it is a normal state -- may be a server was not started at all (`failifexecutionfails="false"`)). Then we clean up the directory at the server where our package was deployed (being unpackaged), removing the package itself and we clean the server cache.

When we redeploy (`redeploy`) -- a default target -- the old version of the package is removed from the server (`undeploy`), temporay directories are cleaned up (`clean`), then package is constructed and deployed to server (`deploy`).

    #!xml
        . . .

        <!-- Prepares deployment -->

            <copy todir="${dist.dir}/war">

Seems that's all :)

**P.S.** Yes, as people give me advices, there is [Tomcat Client Deployer](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-5.5-doc/deployer-howto.html#Deploying%20using%20the%20Client%20Deployer%20Package) -- a package that has a levers to re-deploy with Ant, but it requires a server to be running all the time.

And yes, there are another ways to do it like [CruiseControl](http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/) but it seems for me, it is not so required to setup a packages like this just to redeploy something fast.

And yes I also know now that [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) has a [war-plugin](http://maven.apache.org/maven-1.x/plugins/war/goals.html) for something similar our targets... Maven is fat, forget it :)
